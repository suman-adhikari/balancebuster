Astrologer

Once Aalu maya told me about one astrologer and how good he is and the many friends she had recommended the astrologer and some she accompanied. I had never been to astrologer and never did believe in such stuff. Anyway I asked her if she could take me there. She said she would just tell me the location but later agreed to accompany me. I just wanted her company , i did't care where to, I guess austrologer was just one medium. However lately I wanted to visit an astrologer and see what he will tell about me and how much he will succeed in telling me something i already knew.

She contacted the astrologer but he was out of country in India for some kind of conference or something i dont remember exactly. He was out for like 2 months. So our plan to visit him was posponded. About two months later in 26 feb, 2018, she fixed appointment with him. We planned to reach there at 9 in the morning, so i got up early and got ready by 8:15. I met her at Baneshwor and it was already 9, we took tampo.

She was telling me about her previous encounter with the astrologer relating to his brother, sisters and friends and how positive he his and his ways of delevering the astrologer contents. After few minutes in tempo, people got on and off. There I saw one girl, the girl with greenish blue beautiful eyes. She was with one friend of her talking about the exam or test. Her eyes were so pretty and clear , I just looked at her eyes like 10-20 times. I am pretty sure I must have made her feel uncomfortable or maybe not. I wanted to tell her, she had so beautiful eyes, I didn't but I did tell Aalu maya. She looked at her eyes and she also felt the same way.

We got off at RNAC, she called him, he was out for a while, so we were just roaming around basantapur and it was so much fun. Then she called him again and now we were on our way to the astrologer. We asked like 10 poeple for the way and finally reached there. We waited for him for a while and at the meantime she was making faces and all those crazy things she do, she is so good at that, you can just look at her the whole day.

The Astrologer arrived, talked with us for a while and then started drawing the astrologer things with all those letters and digits in the diamond shaped lines, peeking at the patro and all and analysing everything, there were some mathematical formula sort of things as well. Then he said, lets get started. These are the things he pointed out about me.

- You face is common type of face that can match with other people, like people from india or other foreign nation but not chinese.
- I said I was borm while my mom was cutting grass for cattle, he said I was natural 
- I am really lucky, one in thousands
- All the things according to astrology is in my favour, i have only one negative aspect regaring marriage life but even that wont be problem coz i'll get gyani girl. My marriage's mourath has already started 8 months before. Girls will fall for me and they will attract me with their love. I see inner beauty, beauty of sole rather then face.
-"Double dhan rasi yod", he said people have one dhan rasi yog and thats lucky, I have two, I am so lucky, I will be rich . If I take loan ,I would be able to pay back with ease.
- I have talent in me but i got to push myself, I am someone who should be like scientist 
- My bachelor was not good, but i have potential in me. I am good at pratical things rather then theory.
- I teach very well, people understand what i teach them
- I have influence over people about what i say.
- My father is a popular figure
- I dont show interest in going abroad.
- i am shelfless, i care abt others
- i am hawa typ, i got to push myself for greater things
- i flourish in group work, I have strength in group work, others will work, i get reap from that.
